# HmmBiasResolver

## Introduction
HmmBiasResolver is an Hmm-based model for resolving the bias in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), therefore, improving the performance of EMR data analytics.

## Functionality
HmmBiasResolver takes raw array-like data as input, fills the missing data with an Hmm-based model and then outputs the transformed data in the same shape.
### Input:
* raw array-like data with shape (n_patients, n_timewindows, n_features)
* value range {-1, 0, +1}, with -1 "abnormal", "0" missing, "+1" normal
### Output:
* transformed array-like data with shape (n_patients, n_timewindows, n_features)
* value range [-1, +1]

## Requirements
`hmmlearn==0.2.0`
`numpy==1.13.3`
`progressbar==2.3`
